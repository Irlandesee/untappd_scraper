More hops, without any distraction. More ABV. More flavor. More, more, more but in balance.\n\nThis project started with our endless affection for Wheatland Springs altbier Bauernhof  a beer we loved at first sip and will never tire of drinking. So, when we started talking with John, Bonnie, and Austen about making another beer together, it didnt take long for the conversation to drift towards a doppel (double) altbier. But rather than brew just one, we decided to each brew our own unique take. Think of it as a call and response. Whispers and Rumours.\n\nOur version, Rumours, was brewed with 100% Epiphany Craft Malt. Its base was an even split of the North Carolina maltsers Helles and Vienna malts. Upon that foundation, we added five more speciality grains, all of which helped summon a deep malt richness for an ale that still finishes dry. After primary fermentation, we let the beer condition in stainless steel for six weeks  giving Rumours plenty of time to mature and mellow.\n\nOr so were told. ",
